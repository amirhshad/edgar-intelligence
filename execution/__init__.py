# Execution layer - deterministic Python scripts
#
# This package contains all execution tools for the 3-layer architecture.
# Scripts here handle API calls, data processing, file operations, and database interactions.
#
# Key principle: These scripts are deterministic and testable.
# The orchestration layer (LLM) calls these scripts but doesn't implement logic itself.
